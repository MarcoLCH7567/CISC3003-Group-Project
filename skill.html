				<p>It's getting harder and harder to get out of bed, but there's really no shortage of things to do, to eat, and to celebrate in winter.</p>
				<p>Although people's ears are red from the cold in winter, when I think of candied haws, candied chestnuts and malatang, I immediately feel warm in my heart;</p>
				<p>Although it is cold in winter, people do not want to move, but as long as I think of the warm sun and the lively scene on the street, I have the motivation to go out again];</p>
				<p>Although it is cold in winter, people don't want to take their hands out of their pockets, but when they think of all kinds of beautiful scenery in winter, photographers can't help it anymore. …</p>
				<p>Today, Xiaoai Photography has selected many "winter-flavored" photos from Xiaoai.com. Let's find "fire-like passion for life" in the cold winter photos together~</p>

				<p>When shooting this work, it was minus 30 degrees, and the white hair wind of 6-7 level was untenable. The scene in front of me reminded me of the scene of the day after tomorrow. Think of the scene in the wandering earth.</p>
				<p>The figure in the distance may be a brave man who just returned to the ground from the underground world to find food.</p>

				<p>The morning light of the snowy field was photographed this time last year. Although the hands and feet were cold, people were excited! Watching the sun slowly rise from the white snow field, the colors slowly began to change, and the scene before me was like a fairyland!</p>
